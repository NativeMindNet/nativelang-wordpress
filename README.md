# NativeLang WordPress Plugin

**Empowering Multilingual WordPress Sites with Advanced Translation Capabilities**

NativeLang is a WordPress plugin designed to significantly enhance your website's multilingual capabilities. Built as an extension for the popular Polylang plugin, NativeLang adds advanced translation features that make it easier than ever to manage and deliver content in multiple languages. Its purpose is to offer WordPress users a fast, intuitive, and flexible solution for multilingual content management, while allowing developers and website owners to customize or integrate it into their own WordPress sites.

### ðŸ“¦ Architecture Overview

NativeLang is architected in layers to separate the user interface from core translation logic:

-   **WordPress UI (PHP):** Implements all screens and user interactions (content creation, translation, etc.) via the WordPress dashboard. This layer handles all input/output with the user.
-   **NativeLang Plugin Core (PHP):** The underlying PHP core that handles translation functionality. It manages connections with Polylang and translation configurations. The engine integrates multiple implementations and configurations under a common API.
